        <h2><u><i>Description</i></u></h2>
        <p>Few things are as easy to prepare as these pan-fried boneless pork chops.</p>
        <p>They take only minutes to prepare!</p>

        <!--Ingredients-->
        <h4><i>--Ingredients--</i></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 boneless pork chops, 3/4-inch thick</li>
            <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup cooking oil</li>
        </ul>

        <!--Steps-->
        <h4><i>--Steps--</i></h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Do not pat chops dry, so seasonings and flour will stick.</li>
            <li>Season both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper, then sprinkle with flour on both sides.<br>
                 Use the back of a spoon to distribute the flour over the entire surface.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat until it shimmers. <br>
                Carefully add pork chops and pan fry until brown, about 4 minutes. Do not disturb the chops until ready to turn.</li>
            <li>When you see the edges of the chops turn brown, turn, and pan fry the other side until no longer pink on the inside and brown on the outside, <br>
                an additional 4 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).<br>
                 Reduce heat, if they are browning too quickly. Serve warm.</li>
        </ol>
